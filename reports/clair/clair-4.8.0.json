This flaw allows an attacker to cause unexpected application behavior or a crash by exploiting the buffer overread condition when the function is called with a zero-length client list. This issue is only exploitable if the application is misconfigured to use a zero-length server list and mishandles the 'no overlap' response in ALPN or uses the output as the opportunistic protocol in NPN.","issued":"2024-06-27T00:00:00Z","links":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-5535 https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2294581 https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-5535 https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-5535 https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2024.html#AppendixMSQL https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-5535.json https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:7848","severity":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","normalized_severity":"Low","package":{"id":"","name":"openssl-libs","version":"","kind":"binary","arch":"aarch64|i686|ppc64le|s390x|x86_64"},"distribution":{"id":"","did":"","name":"","version":"","version_code_name":"","version_id":"","arch":"","cpe":"","pretty_name":""},"repository":{"name":"cpe:2.3:o:redhat:enterprise_linux:8:*:baseos:*:*:*:*:*","key":"rhel-cpe-repository","cpe":"cpe:2.3:o:redhat:enterprise_linux:8:*:baseos:*:*:*:*:*"},"fixed_in_version":"1:1.1.1k-14.el8_6","arch_op":"pattern match"},"5212008":{"id":"5212008","updater":"rhel-vex","name":"CVE-2020-19190","description":"A flaw was found in the ncurses library.
